	abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal basically corresponds to the electrical activity of the heart. In the literature, the ECG signal has been analyzed and utilized for various purposes, such as measuring the heart rate, examining the rhythm of heartbeats, diagnosing heart abnormalities, emotion recognition and biometric identification. ECG analysis (depending on the type of the analysis) can contain several steps, such as preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, feature transformation and classification. Performing each step is crucial for the sake of the related analysis. In addition, the employed success measures and appropriate constitution of the ECG signal database play important roles in the analysis as well. In this work, the literature on ECG analysis, mostly from the last decade, is comprehensively reviewed based on all of the major aspects mentioned above. Each step in ECG analysis is briefly described, and the related studies are provided.},

	abstract = {Recent advances of Internet of Medical Things have allowed for continuous heart rhythm monitoring in a comfortable fashion. Single lead Electrocardiograph (ECG) is first collected by the wearable devices, and then some intelligent approaches are employed for automatic recognition of heart rhythms. Because the single lead ECG wave is different from traditional 12-leads Holter-based ECG signal in terms of high noise/artifact and the missing of other channels, specific algorithms for pattern recognition of the single lead ECG waves have been proposed in recent years. This paper systematically surveys state-of-the-art methods for screening atrial fibrillation from a single lead ECG wave. The database and performance metrics for this problem are demonstrated, the data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are collected, and then the learning methods in terms of machine learning and deep learning are comparatively summarized. Specifically, the techniques for data preprocessing are reviewed and the most common and powerful features are listed, which are capable of providing a guideline for researchers aiming at developing AF detection algorithms. Finally, we discuss the potential contributors that are probably helpful for screening the atrial fibrillation from a single lead ECG wave.},

	abstract={Analog filtering and digital signal processing algorithms in the preprocessing modules of an electrocardiographic device play a pivotal role in providing high-quality electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for analysis, interpretation, and presentation (display, printout, and storage). In this article, issues relating to inaccuracy of ECG preprocessing filters are investigated in the context of facilitating efficient ECG interpretation and diagnosis. The discussion covers 4 specific ECG preprocessing applications: anti-aliasing and upper-frequency cutoff, baseline wander suppression and lower-frequency cutoff, line frequency rejection, and muscle artifact reduction. Issues discussed include linear phase, aliasing, distortion, ringing, and attenuation of desired ECG signals. Due to the overlapping power spectrum of signal and noise in acquired ECG data, frequency selective filters must seek a delicate balance between noise removal and deformation of the desired signal. Most importantly, the filtering output should not adversely impact subsequent diagnosis and interpretation. Based on these discussions, several suggestions are made to improve and update existing ECG data preprocessing standards and guidelines.},

	abstract = {Biosensors are emerging as efficient (sensitive and selective) and affordable analytical diagnostic tools for early-stage disease detection, as required for personalized health wellness management. Low-level detection of a targeted disease biomarker (pM level) has emerged extremely useful to evaluate the progression of disease under therapy. Such collected bioinformatics and its multi-aspects-oriented analytics is in demand to explore the effectiveness of a prescribed treatment, optimize therapy, and correlate biomarker level with disease pathogenesis. Owing to nanotechnology-enabled advancements in sensing unit fabrication, device integration, interfacing, packaging, and sensing performance at point-of-care (POC) has rendered diagnostics according to the requirements of disease management and patient disease profile i.e. in a personalized manner. Efforts are continuously being made to promote the state of art biosensing technology as a next-generation non-invasive disease diagnostics methodology. Keeping this in view, this progressive opinion article describes personalized health care management related analytical tools which can provide access to better health for everyone, with overreaching aim to manage healthy tomorrow timely. Considering accomplishments and predictions, such affordable intelligent diagnostics tools are urgently required to manage {COVID}-19 pandemic, a life-threatening respiratory infectious disease, where a rapid, selective and sensitive detection of human beta severe acute respiratory system coronavirus ({SARS}-{COoV}-2) protein is the key factor.},

	abstract = {The development of edge devices with dedicated hardware accelerators has pushed the deployment and inference of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models closer to users and real-world sensory systems than ever before (e.g., wearables, IoT). Recently, a further subset of these devices has emerged: ultra-low power DNN accelerators. These microcontrollers possess a dedicated hardware accelerator and are able to operate with only μJ's of energy in milliseconds of time. With their small form-factor, such devices could be used for battery-powered machine learning (ML) applications. In this work, we take a close look at one such device: the MAX78000 by Maxim Integrated. We characterize the device's performance by running five DNN models of various sizes and architectures, and analyze its operational latency, power consumption, and memory footprint. To better understand the performance characteristics, we take a step further and investigate how different layer types (operation type, kernel size, number of input and output channels) and the selection of accelerator processors affect the execution time.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the creation and use of unique identifiers for intellectual property. General concepts applicable to unique identifiers are defined and discussed [identifier, digital object, dumb and intelligent identifiers, readability, affordance or computability, multiple identification, resolution, metadata, persistence, granularity, derivatives (e.g., versions, formats, manifestations, and copies), check digits, and intermediate objects]. Requirements for unique identifiers are reviewed. Capacity issues for an identifier scheme and business issues (cost, antitrust considerations, and intellectual property rights) are explored. Technical and administrative issues of identifiers are discussed, with particular reference to the uses of identifiers, which necessitates intelligence within a system of unique identifiers (scope, protocol independence, multiple roles, fungibility, persistence, standards, and emerging structural metadata approaches). Two brief illustrations of failure in unique identifiers are given. The role of unique identifiers on the Internet is discussed with explanation of the architecture of uniform resource addressing, specifying the resource from a uniform resource name (URN), names and addresses, URN implementations, and a future digital object infrastructure. Brief examples of unique information identifier systems in music, text, and digital objects in general are discussed. Recommendations are made for actions to assist in the development of future identifiers.},
